      <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
      By Evan Wild
      <!-- use p tag -->
      <p>
        Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
        self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned
        documentary, The Jungle Book.
      <p>
        <!-- use p tag -->

      <p>
        So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this
        article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.

      <h3>Types of bear</h3>
      <!-- use p tag -->
      <p>
        Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then
        it
        was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
      </p>
      <!-- use p tag -->
      <p>
        Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in
        urban
        areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourange different behaviour however, as you'll find
        out below. The below table also gives you some useful facts about bears.

      <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
      <!-- use p tag -->
      <br><br>
      Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other natually growing ingredients. In general they will
      hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their sustenance from farms or
      country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
      <br><br>

      <!-- use p tag -->
      <br><br>
      Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban
      creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from readily
      available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven scarce, urban bears
      have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals, and
      microwave ovens.

      <!-- use alt with concise description -->
      <img src="media/urban-bear.jpg">
      <br><br>
      Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, to their own
      apartment.

      <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
      <!-- use p tag -->
      <br><br>
      Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest of their
      lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example with cave
      paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the case of an
      urban bear.

        <!-- use p tag -->
        <br><br>
        Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been really "in to" wildlife since childhood. He once
        went to Chester Zoo on holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
        <!-- use p tag -->
        <br><br>
        He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about them, and thinks they sound cool.

              <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing
                little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in
                a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.</p>
